# Price-Nest
Overview

The Student Housing Analytics Platform is a web-based application designed to help students—especially international students—understand rental prices and housing affordability near Malaysian universities.
Instead of offering real property listings or booking features, the platform focuses on data-driven insights such as average rental prices, suggested price ranges, affordability indicators, and historical rent trends.

The platform also educates users about the Malaysian rental process by explaining common costs such as booking fees, security deposits, and advance rent. Through interactive charts and a simple, student-friendly interface, users can explore rental patterns by university and nearby areas to make informed decisions before renting.

This project is developed as a Final Year Project (FYP) to demonstrate the use of data analytics, data visualization, and user-centered design in solving a real-world student problem.
